#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing and building computer programs or software systems. Overall, software engineering is about applying structured methods to create reliable and useful software. 

Software engineering is very important in the technology industry because it helps create software that works well and meets user's needs( e.g Quality and Reliability, Efficiency, Cost-Effectiveness, Scalability, Maintainability and Security)


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Agile Methodology- A set of principles and practices for software development that promotes flexibility, collaboration and customer-centricity.

Software Crisis- It highlighted difficulties in managing increasing software complexity, including cost overruns, schedule delays and reliability issues.

Machine Learning and AI Integration- The integration of machine learning and AI into software engineering has led to advancement in automation, predictive analytics and intelligent systems, reshaping how software is designed and optimized.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the Software architecture and user interface.

Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.

Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear, stable requirements and where thorough documentation and planning are crucial. e.g. Developing a payroll system for a company with strict regulations where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change. The structured approach ensures compliance and thorough documentation.

Agile is preferable for projects where adaptability, ongoing user feedback, and iterative development are key to delivering value and meeting evolving needs. e.g. Developing a new e-commerce platform where user preferences and market conditions are expected to evolve. Agile allows for iterative development, regular user feedback, and adjustments based on real-world use.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 

Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan.

Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are vital for modern software development as they improve efficiency, reduce errors, and offer a range of tools that support debugging, testing, and project management. They create an integrated and streamlined environment that enhances the overall development experience. e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA

Version Control Systems are essential for managing code effectively, enabling collaboration, ensuring data safety, and supporting best practices in software development. They provide a structured approach to tracking changes, coordinating team efforts, and maintaining code quality throughout the development process. e.g Git, Subversion.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.

Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can results in rushed development and compromised quality.

Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debtcan impede future development efforts and increased maintenance costs.

Strategies to overcome challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timeliness.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing-Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development where individual parts of a software application are tested separately to ensure they work correctly.
Unit testing is crucial for ensuring software quality because it helps in early bug detection, improves code quality, provides valuable documentation, facilitates continuous integration, simplifies debugging, supports agile development, reduces costs, and encourages better design practices. By incorporating unit testing into the development process, teams can significantly enhance the reliability and maintainability of their software.

Integration testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Integration testing is essential because it ensures that different parts of a software system work together as expected, helps detect issues early, and contributes to the overall reliability and functionality of the application. By focusing on the interactions between components, integration testing helps deliver a seamless and dependable software experience.

System testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
System testing is crucial because it verifies that the entire software application works correctly and meets user requirements when used as a whole. It helps catch any issues that might affect the overall functionality and quality of the software, ensuring a reliable and effective end product.





Acceptance testing- Testing the software against usee Requirements to ensure it meets user's needs.
Acceptance testing is essential for ensuring that the software is both functional and satisfactory from the end user's viewpoint, which ultimately helps in delivering a high-quality product.






#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering refers to the process of designing and crafting inputs (prompts) to effectively interact with and guide AI models, particularly language models like ChatGPT. It involves creating questions or commands that elicit the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI.
Prompt engineering is important when interacting with AI models because it helps you get better and more accurate responses. e.g Clear communication, Gets better results, Saves time, Handles complex tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- "Give me information in AI"
Improved prompt- "Can you explain the latest advancements in artificial intelligence?"

This prompt is clearer and more focused, helping the AI provide a precise and relevant answer about AI.
