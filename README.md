Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing and building computer programs or software systems. Overall, software engineering is about applying structured methods to create reliable and useful software. Software engineering is very important in the technology industry because it helps create software that works well and meets user's needs( e.g Quality and Reliability, Efficiency, Cost-Effectiveness, Scalability, Maintainability and Security)


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Agile Methodology- A set of principles and practices for software development that promotes flexibility, collaboration and customer-centricity.
Software Crisis- It highlighted difficulties in managing increasing software complexity, including cost overruns, schedule delays and reliability issues.
Machine Learning and AI Integration- The integration of machine learning and AI into software engineering has led to advancement in automation, predictive analytics and intelligent systems, reshaping how software is designed and optimized.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the Software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear, stable requirements and where thorough documentation and planning are crucial. e.g. Developing a payroll system for a company with strict regulations where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change. The structured approach ensures compliance and thorough documentation.
Agile is preferable for projects where adaptability, ongoing user feedback, and iterative development are key to delivering value and meeting evolving needs. e.g. Developing a new e-commerce platform where user preferences and market conditions are expected to evolve. Agile allows for iterative development, regular user feedback, and adjustments based on real-world use.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
